The creation of the Municipality of Sofronio Española took nearly two decades. Resolution No. 120 dated December 12, 1988, of the Sangguniang Bayan of Brooke’s Point proposed the separation of its northern barangays, namely, Abo-Abo, Isumbo, Panitian, Labog, Punang, Iraray, Pulot Shore, Pulot Center, and Pulot Interior, into a new municipality. The proposed municipality is to be called Sofronio Española in honor of the late Congressman Sofronio Española of the then lone district of Palawan. Barangay Resolution dated April 16, 1990, of Barangay Pulot reinforced this move requesting Hon. Ramon V. Mitra, Jr., then Speaker of the House of Representatives, to facilitate the creation of the new municipality. On July 9, 1992, Hon. Alfredo E. Abueg Jr., then congressman of the Second District of Palawan, filed House Bill No. 60, An Act Creating the Municipality of Sofronio Española in the Province of Palawan. To expedite the approval of this bill, Board Member Cipriano Barroma sponsored Sangguniang Panlalawigan Resolution No. 120 on April 16, 1993. The House of Representatives approved Republic Act (RA) No. 7679, the law creating the Municipality of Sofronio Española in the Province of Palawan on August 3, 1993, and by the Senate on November 25, 1993. Finally, the bill creating Sofronio Española lapsed into law on February 24, 1994, in accordance with Article VI, Section 27(1) of the Constitution. Pursuant to above-cited Act, the seat of government shall be in Barangay Pulot Center. Municipal Planning and Development Office In order to acquire corporate existence as a municipality, the people of the then mother municipality, Brooke’s Point, and the proposed municipality casted their votes during plebiscite held on May 22, 1994, resulting in an overwhelming majority vote in favour of the creation of the Municipality of Sofronio Española. From this date started the corporate existence of the Local Government Unit (LGU) of Sofronio Española. To start public operations and ensure delivery of service to the public, the LGU then rented a residential house from Mr. Eduardo Pardian which served as the temporary, mandatory office of the newly created municipality. The Office was first managed and run by the first appointed Municipal Officials and replaced by the first-ever elected Municipal Officials during the 1995 election. The LGU then transferred to the newly constructed Municipal Hall Building located at Pulot Center, Sofronio Española, Palawan, in June 1998.
